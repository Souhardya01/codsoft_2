Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe with AI game! This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic game, enhanced with an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm. The AI uses Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficiency, making the game challenging and engaging.

Features :
Human vs AI Gameplay: Play against a highly skilled AI opponent.
Interactive Console UI: Intuitive board layout for easy play.
Unbeatable AI: The AI ensures a challenging game, utilizing advanced algorithms to make optimal moves.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes AI performance, reducing unnecessary calculations.

How to Play
Run the script using Python:
The game starts with a welcome message. You play as X, and the AI plays as O.
Make your move by entering a number (1-9) corresponding to the board positions:
 1 | 2 | 3
==+===+==
 4 | 5 | 6
==+===+==
 7 | 8 | 9
The AI will then make its move. Continue playing until:

You win üèÜ.
The AI wins ü§ñ.
The game ends in a draw ü§ù.

Code Highlights
Board Representation: The board is a simple list of 9 elements, with positions mapped to numbers 1-9 for user convenience.
Minimax Algorithm: The AI evaluates all possible moves to make the optimal choice.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Speeds up decision-making by eliminating unneeded branches of the game tree.
Customizable Board Design: The visual layout of the board is clean and easy to understand.
